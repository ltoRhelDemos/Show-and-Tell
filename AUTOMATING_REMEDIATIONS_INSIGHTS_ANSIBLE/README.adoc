= RED HAT INSIGHTS: UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S INSIDE - LTO Show & Tell Series

== Description
This Show&Tell is aimed to share some of the most important concepts and features of Insights and how it can help to customer looking for stability, availability, security and performance in their Operating System Grid.

Audience: IT Managers, Architects and technical staff who operates Linux

:numbered:

== Introduction
As existing workloads evolve and deployments grow in size and complexity, risk management is a key challenge for enterprise IT. To succeed, operations departments need to rapidly deploy new environments and ensure systems scale reliably. Red Hat® Insights helps customers benefit from the experience and technical knowledge of Red Hat Certified Engineers (RHCEs®) and makes it easier for users to identify, prioritize, and resolve issues before business operations are affected.

Red Hat Insights provides highly scalable, prescriptive analytics across complete, hybrid infrastructures. Red Hat Insights is also now included in all supported versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux®, enabling users to proactively detect issues, enhance visibility into their deployments, improve security, and prescribe remediation through familiar tools like Red Hat Satellite.

Delivered as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering, Red Hat Insights takes advantage of Red Hat’s industry expertise as a leader in open source software to generate tailored remediations in real time.

Red Hat Insights uses intelligent data to pinpoint technical risks and help IT resolve problems before business is affected. This modern, integrated platform supports operational analytics and automated resolution across physical, virtual, container, and private and public cloud environments.

== How to install the client

The client for RHEL 8 is installed by default. In case other version (version>=6.4) the installation is pretty straightforward.

Before any installation you need to register the server with the appropriate subscription, which has to be active.

[source,bash]
---------------------
[root@server ~]# subscription-manager register --auto-attach
---------------------

The installation of the client is as follows . Remember to register the server to insights after the rpm installation.

*RHEL version < 8*

[source,bash]
---------------------
[root@server ~]# yum install redhat-access-insights
[root@server ~]#  redhat-access-insights --register
Automatic scheduling for Insights has been enabled.
Starting to collect Insights data for archimedes
Uploading Insights data.
Successfully uploaded report from archimedes to account xxxxxxxx.
---------------------

*RHEL version 8*

[source,bash]
---------------------
[root@server ~]# yum install insights-client
[root@server ~]#  insights-clients --register
Automatic scheduling for Insights has been enabled.
Starting to collect Insights data for archimedes
Uploading Insights data.
Successfully uploaded report from archimedes to account xxxxxxxx.
---------------------

The automated versions can be located at ansible or puppet links.

Is good practice to configure the servers you want to subscribe to insights through a proxy, so the server aren't exposed directly to a public connection. 

== What does insights client when it is registering the server?

The client starts a protocol to get the server registered looking at the subscription validity. If the subscription is valid and up to date, the server is registered.

The client try to register the instance through port 443 on

[source,bash]
---------------------
https://cert-api.access.redhat.com/r/insights/uploads
---------------------

After a successful registration, the client creates an autonomous task for uploading data daily. 

In RHEL versions 7.4 and below versions, it uses cron and creates an entry in /etc/cron.daily.

I RHEL versions 7.5 and above, it uses a timer in systemd that can be changed using

[source,bash]
---------------------
[root@server ~]# systemctl edit insights-client.timer
The file can be found at /usr/lib/systemd/system/.
---------------------

Please refer to “Creating Custom Schedule for Red Hat Insights Uploads”.

In big environments is desirable not to make all servers upload data at the same time. For this reason there is a random delay time variable called RandomizedDelaySec that can be changed in the timer file to resolve the bulk uploads that can impact the network.

After the configuration of a scheduled task, insights client start the first data collection which is sent to insights service right away.

After this, the registration process finish. The next upload will happen automatically daily and the service is set permanently. The data uploaded can be seen at the service portal.

== What data is sent to Red Hat Insights service?

The data collected by insights could be reviewed and validated using --no-upload keyword as follows.

[source,bash]
---------------------
[root@server ~]# insights-client --no-upload
Starting to collect Insights data for server
Archive saved at /var/tmp/h517f24d/insights-server-20190923155120.tar.gz
---------------------

In this example a compressed file is stored in a random generated folder in /var/tmp. The files collected are configuration files and the output of different commands that are sent to the service for analysis and recommendations.

You can also refer to “System Information Collected by Red Hat Insights”

Also you can refer to the information depicted in the uploader.json from the insights api.

== Can I exclude data?

The information sent to the insights service is related mostly to the server configuration. Nevertheless, some customers could have the need of not sending all the information, that by default, insights collect.

In this case, customers could decide to trim the information collected or obfuscate hostnames and/or ip addresses as needed.

For obfuscating hostname and/or ip address, edit the file 

[source,bash]
---------------------
/etc/insights-client/insights-client.conf 
---------------------

Uncomment the following lines and set to True.

[source,bash]
---------------------
# Obfuscate IP addresses
#obfuscate=False

# Obfuscate hostname. Requires obfuscate=True.
#obfuscate_hostname=False
---------------------

[NOTE]
Obfuscating IP addresses and host names will cause difficulties in identifying systems in the Insights UI. For instance, host0 will be displayed for all systems if host names are obfuscated. When registering systems to Red Hat Insights be sure to use the --display-name option to set a UI name to avoid this issue.

[source,bash]
---------------------
# Display name for registration
#display_name=
---------------------

The Red Hat Insights collection agent has the ability to exclude (blacklist) entire files, specific commands, specific patterns, and specific keywords from the data that is sent to Red Hat.

To enable these exclusions, you must create a file called */etc/insights-client/remove.conf* and specify this file in the remove_file line of */etc/insights-client/insights-client.conf*, as in the following example:

[source,bash]
---------------------
remove_file=/etc/insights-client/remove.conf
---------------------

An example of a remove.conf file is below.

[source,bash]
---------------------
[remove]
files=/etc/cluster/cluster.conf,/etc/hosts
commands=/bin/dmesg
patterns=password,username
---------------------

See the detailed procedure in *“Opting Out of Sending Metadata from Red Hat Insights Client”*.

Any omission of metadata will impact any analysis related to the data avoided.
 
== Force to upload data to Insights Service

When you apply remediation steps to your servers could be useful to refresh the information of servers touched by the procedures implemented. This could be done using the client without parameters.

[source,bash]
---------------------
[root@server ~]# insights-client
Starting to collect Insights data for server
Uploading Insights data.
Successfully uploaded report from archimedes to account xxxxxxxxx.
---------------------

== Unregistering a server

A server can be unregistered using the command line. 

[source,bash]
---------------------
[root@server ~]# insights-client --unregister
Successfully unregistered from the Red Hat Insights Service
---------------------

== Integrating Insights with others: using the API with python

Insights expose a powerful API in order to interact with the service.

A good article to start with is “Managing the Insights API”

Using python for interacting with python is very fun and easy.

A very simple class for listing the servers and IDs registered to insights.

[source,bash]
---------------------
import json
import sys
from pprint import pprint

try:
    import requests
except ImportError:
    print("Please install the python-requests module.")
    sys.exit(-1)

SSL_VERIFY = True

###############################################                
class InsightsRequest:

	def __init__(self):
		self.data = None
		self.rules=None
		self.credentials = loadCredentials()
	#------------------------
	def fetchHostsInfo(self):
		r = requests.get(
"https://cloud.redhat.com/api/inventory/v1/hosts",
			auth=(self.credentials["username"], self.credentials["password"]),
			verify=SSL_VERIFY,
			params="")
		self.data = r.json()
		return r.json()

	#------------------------
	def getHostsInfo(self):
		return self.data

	#------------------------
	def getRegisteredHostsDisplayNames(self):
		returnValue = []
		if self.data != None:
			for host in self.data["results"]: returnValue.append(host["display_name"])
	
	#------------------------
	def getRegisteredHostsIds(self):
		returnValue = []
		if self.data != None:
			for host in self.data["results"]: returnValue.append([host["display_name"],host["id"]])		
		return returnValue
		
###############################################                
def loadCredentials():
	
	# ~ The format of credentials.txt must be
	# ~ {
		# ~ "username":"your username",
		# ~ "password":"your password"
	# ~ }

	json_data = None
	with open('credentials.txt', 'r') as f:
		data = f.read()
		json_data = json.loads(data)
		
	return json_data
		
###############################################                
if __name__=='__main__':
#----------------------------------------------
	
	insightsData = InsightsRequest()
	
	insightsData.fetchHostsInfo()
	
	for serverId in insightsData.getRegisteredHostsIds(): 
       print(serverId)
---------------------

It is important to notice that these are demonstration scripts and commands. Ensure you review these scripts carefully before use, and replace any variable, user names, passwords, and other information to suit your own demonstration deployment.

== How to connect the servers to the service?

Insights can be connected in several ways to Insights Service. The simplest way is the direct connection in which the server is exposed to the internet so the insights client can send the information collected directly to the red hat servers.

Each server send their information to the insights server for real-time analysis.

image::insights-fig1.png[]

The second way is through a https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1606693[proxy server]. In this mode the server is not exposed directly to the internet, which is a good security practice. In this connection model the server send the it’s information to the proxy and this forward it to insights servers.

image::insights-fig2.png[]

A third way is through Satellite, in which the application integrates Insights and acts as a proxy for establishing a curtain. 

Satellite could be used as a single control pane for management and monitoring the health of the servers

image::insights-fig3.png[]

Integrated with ansible could execute command the execution of the remediation playbooks proposed by Insights.

The connection will depend on the particular aspects of each and every customer.

== A brief tour of Insights Web GUI.

The Insights service presents itself on a web gui which can be accessed anywhere. The following screenshots shows the main parts of the tool.

To access the tool only need to go to:

https://cloud.redhat.com/insights/overview

The first screen you’ll see is the dashboard. The dashboard is the window to reality. It shows what is identified in all servers registered.

A classification is depicted in the top-right corner of the tool. This classification is very useful due to the fact that any issue identified is segmented in four categories: Availability, Stability, Performance and Security, which in turn guide the customer to which rules have matched the customer’s platform and help identify very rapidly which servers are affected in which category.

image::insights-fig4.png[]

Another interesting part of the dashboard is the severity classification. All the issued are classified into four other categories related to severity: Critical, Important, moderate and Low.

Having this to segmented spaces let the customer identify and prioritize in an easier way how to start their plan for remediation.

Now, let’s see the left part of this first screen of this tool. Such is the case of the main mane of options that list Overview (our dashboard), Rules, Inventory and Remediation.

image::insights-fig5.png[]

In the tab of Rules, the customer can read all the issues (rules that match) encountered in all servers registered to the service. 

The list also shows the Total Risk, Servers affected and, in case a playbook exists, a green check indicating a playbook is available for the remediation of the issue.

Each issue or rule matched is a link that can be followed to understand and obtain detailed information of the issue. Also when we click on the rule it is possible to see which systems are affected to go through the link proposed to navigate to the server.

image::insights-fig6.png[]

The Inventory link proposes another view of the tool for accessing directly the servers affected and see all the rules that match identifying possible issued to be resolved.

image::insights-fig7.png[]

Clicking the server we are redirected to enter view specific to the host selected.

image::insights-fig8.png[]

We can see four horizontal tabs that by default select “General Information” of the server.

The tab “Insights” shows all the rules (issues) identified in the server selected.

image::insights-fig9.png[]

The description of each rule and the remediation steps are described.

Selecting one or several rules allows us to generate an Ansible Playbook if available.

image::insights-fig10.png[]

The tab “Vulnerabilities” shows CVEs identified on the server.

image::insights-fig11.png[]

The tab “Compliance” could be used in conjunction with openScap for generating compliance reports.

In the left menu the item “Remediation”, will show all the playbooks generated for different combinations created by admins for remediate groups or individual servers.

Also, we can manage all playbooks (ie. delete them), download them for modify or view them and then send them to the Ansible Engine Tower for the automated remediation execution.

== The Rights Message of Insights!
 
Insights is a great tool, at no cost for our customers. 

The predictive nature of it could help our customers to anticipate problems in its environments, giving administrators the time to plan the possible remediations needed to have an up to date platform without risks.

Insights is a Diagnostic tool because all the issues identified for certain servers establishes a server diagnostic that describes the risks at which the server is exposed.

The diagnostic is complemented with a fair amount of information which turns Insights into a Descriptive tool. In fact, every issue is well documented and linked with the original sources for better understanding of the issue itself, with its risks, likelihood and risk of change involved.

One cool thing about Insights is its capability to be Prescriptive. In this sense, Insights not only identify an issue, but also propose the remediation steps tested by Red Hat. 

In some cases, Insights is capable of sharing with the customer Ansible Playbooks in which the remediation steps are included. This way not only the remediation is proposed but a way of automate it.

== Conclusions

Insights is a valuable tool for all our customers. After RHEL 8 Announcement, in may 2019, insights become a fundamental part of Red Hat Subscription. Customers can install and use it in every RHEL registered server.

What customers obtain from this tool is so valuable that it will transform how they interact and operate their operating environment fabric based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

RHEL is the first Intelligent operating system and it is ready to serve to the mission critical data centers, using Insights.
